It handles various aspects of the business, including user management, vehicle management, firm management, product management,            material management, production tracking, sales transactions, and delivery records. The system also supports chat functionality and a dashboard for displaying statistics and charts.
         This backend is built with Express.js and uses Sequelize ORM for database interactions. It also features robust search, sort, pagination, and filtering capabilities.
